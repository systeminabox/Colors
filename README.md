# Colors

Added a class Colors()

Colors() has methods void SetTextColor(int color) which can take a number to determine the text color. There is a bunch of integer variables in this class that are for each color for example Colors().blue is 1. This goes together to look like Colors().SetTextColor(Colors.blue)
